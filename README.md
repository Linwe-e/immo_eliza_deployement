## Overview

Welcome to the Immo Eliza Deployment project! This repository contains the necessary scripts and notebooks for preprocessing data, setting up a machine learning pipeline, and ultimately deploying the "Immo Eliza" model. The primary goal is to provide a robust and reproducible workflow for deploying a model, likely related to real estate predictions.

## Features

*   **Data Preprocessing**: Scripts and notebooks for cleaning, transforming, and preparing data for model training.
*   **Pipeline Construction**: Implementation and testing of a machine learning pipeline for streamlined model training and prediction.
*   **Model Deployment Focus**: The project is structured with the end goal of deploying the trained Immo Eliza model.

├── data/                              # Optional: Directory for raw and processed data (ensure .gitignore is configured for large files).
├── requirements.txt                   # Lists project dependencies.
└── README.md                          # This file.
```

*(Note: The `src/`, `models/`, and `data/` directories are common conventions and can be added as your project grows.)*

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   Python (version 3.8 or higher recommended)
*   pip (Python package installer)
*   Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab (for running `.ipynb` files)

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment (e.g., using venv)
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows:
# venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/immo_eliza_deployement.git
    cd immo_eliza_deployement
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    If you have a `requirements.txt` file, install the dependencies using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(If you don't have one yet, you can create it using `pip freeze > requirements.txt` after installing all necessary packages.)*

## Usage

1.  **Data Preprocessing**:
    Open and run the `preprocess_code_better.ipynb` notebook to understand and execute the data cleaning and preparation steps.
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook preprocess_code_better.ipynb
    # or
    jupyter lab preprocess_code_better.ipynb
    ```

2.  **Pipeline Setup and Testing**:
    Open and run the `test_setup_pipeline.ipynb` notebook to see how the machine learning pipeline is constructed and tested.
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook test_setup_pipeline.ipynb
    # or
    jupyter lab test_setup_pipeline.ipynb
    ```

3.  **Deployment**:
    *(This section should be updated with specific instructions once the deployment strategy is finalized. For example, instructions for Docker, a cloud platform, or a web framework like Flask/FastAPI.)*

## Technologies Used

*   **Python**: Core programming language.
*   **Jupyter Notebooks**: For interactive development, data exploration, and pipeline testing.
*   **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis (likely used in preprocessing).
*   **Scikit-learn**: For building machine learning pipelines and models (likely used).
*   **NumPy**: For numerical operations (likely used).
*   *(Add other key libraries or frameworks as applicable, e.g., Flask, FastAPI, Docker, specific cloud services)*
